# Cause-modified Life Table Algorithm
## Sample report created by R Markdown

This is a reproducible research project based on an article by Professor Kevin P. Brand at the University of Ottawa, Canada. This article [Kevin P. Brand, Risk Analysis 25: 695-709 (2005)] mainly discussed an algorithm referred to as the cause-modified life table (CMLT). Also, an approach for approximating that algorithm has been used to obtain remarkably simplified expressions of three population health summary measures: life-years lost (LYL), excess lifetime risk ratio (ELRR), and risk of exposure-induced death (REID). 

In this project, I reproduced Professor Brand's CMLT approximations using the Canadian lung cancer mortality data for 2010. I explored whether such an algoritm can be applied to two other causes of death with the exposure of alcohol consumption.

This work relies heavily on the statistics platform RStudio (freeware that has a power and versatility that well suits the purposes).

Data used in this project are retrieved from the Human Mortality Database (www.mortality.org). It was created to provide open, international access to detailed mortality and population. The database contains original life tables for 37 countries or areas, as well as all raw data used in constructing those tables.
